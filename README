=========

A rails server to manage registrations for the 2013 San Francisco Journey to the End of the Night

It is set up to use heroku, so stores secrets in environment variables (kept in .env, which is not checked in to the repo).  Environment variables required are:
SECRET_KEY_BASE
ADMIN_LOGIN
ADMIN_PASSWORD
FACEBOOK_KEY
FACEBOOK_SECRET
GOOGLE_KEY
GOOGLE_SECRET
TWITTER_KEY
TWITTER_SECRET

To run using the same method as will be run on heroku (including environment settings), run:
RACK_ENV=development PORT=3000 foreman start

To load up seed data
rake db:seed
(or to overwrite the seed data using the current db data, RAILS4=true WITHOUT_PROTECTION=false rake db:seed:dump)
